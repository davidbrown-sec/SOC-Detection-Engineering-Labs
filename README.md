# SOC-Detection-Engineering-Labs
Hi — I’m **David Brown**, a cybersecurity professional focused on **Security Operations (SOC), detection engineering, and SIEM-based threat monitoring**. This portfolio showcases hands-on labs that emphasize **real-world SOC workflows**, data quality, detection logic, and investigation-ready telemetry.

My work prioritizes **getting the data right first** — ingestion, parsing, normalization — before building alerts, dashboards, and response workflows. Every project here is designed to mirror how modern SOC teams actually operate.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 📧 Splunk Email Parsing & Phishing Detection Lab

**Category:** SOC Detection Engineering

**What this project demonstrates:**

- Ingesting raw `.eml` files as **single, complete events** (headers + HTML)
- Troubleshooting and fixing **event-breaking and parsing issues** in Splunk
- Reliable field extraction for email headers
- Detection logic for phishing campaign identification

**Skills shown:** Splunk parsing · props.conf tuning · email security · phishing detection · SOC validation workflows

## 🧠 How to Review This Portfolio (Recruiter-Friendly)

If you’re reviewing this portfolio:

1. Start with the **Splunk Email Phishing Lab** — it highlights parsing, detection, and SOC thinking
2. Review detection queries and validation steps
3. Note the emphasis on **data quality, repeatability, and documentation**

These are the same skills used daily by SOC analysts and detection engineers.
